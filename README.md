# ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡³ TunLang â€” Tunisian Language Understanding and Generation Platform

TunLang is an open-source platform for understanding and generating Tunisian dialect (Derja), aiming to support educational, cultural, and AI-based applications in Tunisia.

##  Overview

TunLang is designed to process, analyze, and generate text in Tunisian Arabic using modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It provides tools, models, and datasets for:

- Text classification and sentiment analysis
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Text generation (e.g., chatbots, question answering)
- Speech-to-text and text-to-speech in Derja
- Translation between Derja and French/Modern Standard Arabic

##  Features

-  Transformer-based language models fine-tuned on Derja (CamemBERT, mBART, AraBERT, etc.)
-  Tokenization and preprocessing adapted to Tunisian dialect
-  Datasets of real-world Tunisian text (social media, interviews, etc.)
-  Tools for training and evaluating custom NLP models
-  Speech modules using Whisper / Mozilla TTS
-  Modular and extensible architecture (Flask API + Web Interface)
